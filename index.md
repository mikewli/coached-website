## Coached

Welcome Project Ascension members! I've wanted for some time to create an app to support the community and couldn't be more excited for you to beta test the app!

Why use this instead of Trainerize:
- recurring workouts
- recurring tasks
- plate calculator
- reading and saving body weight, fat percentage data from/to the Health app (on iOS only for now)
- importing the data from Trainerize from day one
- deeper integration with MyFitnessPal
- emoji support üòÅ
- messaging

There are so many other features I'd love to implement but this is the first version!

A few important ones I'd like to call out that I will be implementing in the future:
- sleep tracking
- step counting
- tracking exercises other than weightlifting
- Apple Watch support
- calendar view
- offline mode
- meal recommendations
- push notifications
- local notifications

Please contact your fitness coach to get started to test the app via TestFlight or Google Play.

This app is currently in beta, so please bear with me if there are bugs or errors; you can report them via feedback through the app settings tab.
